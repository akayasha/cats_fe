# Feed Component

The `FeedComponent` is an Angular standalone component that displays a feed of cat images. It allows users to upload, populate, delete, and load more images through infinite scrolling. It also handles error scenarios gracefully, displaying appropriate messages to the user.

---

## Features

1. **Display Feed of Cat Images**
  - Shows a grid of images with lazy loading for better performance.

2. **Upload New Images**
  - Uploads an image file to the server via the `CatImageService`.

3. **Delete Images**
  - Deletes an image using its unique ID.

4. **Populate Feed**
  - Populates the feed with pre-existing or random images from the server.

5. **Infinite Scrolling**
  - Automatically loads more images as the user scrolls down.

6. **Error Handling**
  - Displays error messages on upload or any other failure scenarios.
  - Opens a dialog box with error details when a failure occurs.

## Dependencies

- [Angular Material](https://material.angular.io/) (for the dialog and styling)
- [CatImageService](../services/cat-image.service.ts) (service for API communication)
- [ErrorDialogComponent](../app/error-dialog/error-dialog.component.ts) (for displaying error dialogs)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository and navigate to your project directory.
2. Make sure Angular is installed in your environment.
3. Install the dependencies by running:

   ```
   npm install
   ```
4. Import the FeedComponent wherever needed:
    ```
     import { FeedComponent } from './components/feed.component';
    ```
---
## Usage
1. Add the component in your desired module or HTML file:

    ```
    <app-feed></app-feed>
    ```
2. Ensure the following services and dependencies are provided in your project:
  - `CatImageService` for API calls.
  - `MatDialog` for opening the error dialog.
  - Proper routing and backend endpoints for uploading, deleting, and retrieving images.

## Error Handling
The component handles errors gracefully:

- When an image upload fails, it extracts the error message from the server and displays it in both an error message div and a dialog box.

## Example of Error Display:
- <div class="error-message">{{ errorMessage }}</div>
     ```
     <div class="error-message">{{ errorMessage }}</div>
    ```
- Dialog-based error handling:
    ```
    this.dialog.open(ErrorDialogComponent, {
      width: '400px',
      data: { errorMessage: backendMessage }
    });
    ```

### Future Improvements
1. add additional filtering or sorting options for images.
